                    <h2>Jurassic Outfitting Co.</h2>
                    <p>This was the first proper website I ever created, a culmination of all the HTML and CSS skills I
                        had
                        learned throughout the semester. It was developed to be a part of the official Jurassic Park
                        website
                        if it ever opened in real life, providing gear and equipment to all those that visited. This
                        project
                        was unlike any others I have done in school, being by far the largest scale project I had ever
                        done
                        (2 months). This quickly led to a struggle to stay on track, but my partner and I quickly
                        learned
                        how to effectively collaborate by splitting up work according to our strengths and weaknesses.
                        Following this project, I became well accustomed to structuring and styling websites.

                    <h2>EECU Budget Calculator</h2>
                    <p>After dipping my toes in Javascript for a few weeks, I got an opportunity to create a full scale
                        site
                        with HTML, CSS, and Javascript when the Educational Employees Credit Union (EECU) requested us
                        to
                        design and develop an online budget calculator. Following this project, I gained a solid
                        understanding of manipulating the DOM and how to use external libraries because I used chart.js.
                        For
                        most of the project, my class did rotations where other students developed for you. I struggled
                        at
                        first because I felt obligated to give other students work to do, but I persisted and became
                        much
                        better at planning development.</p>

                    <h2>Battleship Unknown</h2>
                    <p>Battleship Unknown is a web based adaptation of the board game battleship with its own unique
                        twists.
                        This project had me use all of the web development skills that I had gained throughout the year
                        â€“
                        market research, wireframing in Figma, creating flowcharts, and then programming with HTML, CSS,
                        and
                        Javascript. This project really fine-tuned my ability to manipulate HTML and CSS with Javascript
                        through my use of CSS animations and managing game states. This project put my javascript skills
                        to
                        the test as programming all the logic for such a game was unlike anything I had done using
                        javascript before. This resulted in my partner and I spending lots of time working on game logic
                        together. Eventually, however, we split off and my partner focused on styling while I managed
                        the
                        game logic, an intertwined process that improved my communication skills when developing.</p>
