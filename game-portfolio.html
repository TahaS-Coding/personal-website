                <h2>Road Rolla</h2>
                <p>After playing around with Unity and teaching myself the basics of programming by learning C#, this
                    was the first complete game I ever created. As my first game, I followed plenty of tutorials and
                    used many assets for the environment. However, the project allowed me to create a full game from
                    start to finish, modeling in blender then programming in Unity. Since I did this project on my own
                    time, I struggled getting the motivation to finish when things got difficult. I quickly learned that
                    if I wanted to make successful games in the future, I had to treat game development like a proper
                    project with planning for development and setting aside dedicated time in my day.

                <h2>Rock Paper Scissors SLAP!</h2>
                <p>This was the second complete game I developed, once again using Blender, Unity, and C#. I treated
                    this game like a proper project – I planned for development on paper before I started programming.
                    Additionally, all the game assets other than some icons and sounds were handcrafted for my game.
                    When I completed my game, I thought that it was only a matter of time before it was successful, but
                    boy was I wrong. Every mobile and web based publisher I sent the game to rejected me. What I learned
                    from this experience is that one can’t just develop a game and expect others to play it. In the
                    future, I know I can't just develop any idea, but instead come up with an addicting gameplay loop. I
                    also learned that it does not matter how good a game is if nobody ever sees it, marketing is just as
                    important as development.
